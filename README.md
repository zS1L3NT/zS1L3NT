## üëã Introduction
Hello! I am Zechariah Tan of Temasek Polytechnic Singapore. I build websites and bots for myself and friends for fun, but hope to make a living through it.

I was 13 years old, 2017, when I first saw my friend show me this cool "trick" of Inspect Element on websites. I was amazed at how complex the HTML code of the website was, which inspired me to learn how to build my own websites. I started off learning HTML, CSS and JS but dropped it because I had low motivation to continue. 

In January 2020, I went to the Polytechnic open houses in Singapore to take a look at the courses available. It was then that my interest in Programming was sparked again. From then till today, I have been pursuing my passion for programming

## üíª What I'm working on **right now**

### Portfolio (ReactTS)
This is my Portfolio website which will give a better description of me, showcase all my projects and my TailWind Skills.
