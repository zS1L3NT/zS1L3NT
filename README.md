## üëã Introduction
Hello! I am Zechariah Tan of Temasek Polytechnic Singapore. I build websites and bots for myself and friends for fun, but hope to make a living through it.

I was 13 years old, 2017, when I first saw my friend show me this cool "trick" of Inspect Element on websites. I was amazed at how complex the HTML code of the website was, which inspired me to learn how to build my own websites. I started off learning HTML, CSS and JS but dropped it because I had low motivation to continue. 

In January 2020, I went to the Polytechnic open houses in Singapore to take a look at the courses available. It was then that my interest in Programming was sparked again. From then till today, I have been pursuing my passion for programming

## üíª What I'm working on **right now**

### Statify (ReactTS, Redux)
Statify is a website for you to check your Spotify listening history. This is built with the Spotify API. This website is to warm me up in my Atomic Design so that I can apply it in my Portfolio website.

### Portfolio (ReactTS)
This is my Portfolio website which will give a better description of me, showcase all my projects and my TailWind Skills.

Even though I have done lots of React, I think it's good to learn a few design frameworks to broaden my knowledge of web design

I enjoy the memory management in C++ and hope to one day build a major project with C++

## üéâ What I do in my free time
I am a fan of IU, a Korean singer, songwrite and actress! I love Korean dramas and also spend a lot of nights just binging on episodes that never seem to end
