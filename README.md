## üëã Introduction
Hello! I am Zechariah Tan of Temasek Polytechnic Singapore. I build websites and bots for myself and friends for fun, but hope to make a living through it.

I was 13 years old, 2017, when I first saw my friend show me this cool "trick" of Inspect Element on websites. I was amazed at how complex the HTML code of the website was, which inspired me to learn how to build my own websites. I started off learning HTML, CSS and JS but dropped it because I had low motivation to continue. 

In January 2020, I went to the Polytechnic open houses in Singapore to take a look at the courses available. It was then that my interest in Programming was sparked again. From then till today, I have been pursuing my passion for programming

## üå± What I'm currenly learning
**Laravel and Vue**<br>
I need to be very familiar with these new web technologies because in my Polytechnic, I will be training for a competition called WorldSkills which uses these two Frameworks

**Rust**<br>
As a Typescripter, Rust seems like a really cool version of Typescript which has great performance and doesn't have Typescript memory issues, since it uses the concept of Ownership

## üéâ What I do in my free time
I am a big fan of the board game Chess. I have been recently spending a few hours a week just playing Chess and studying my own games. My rating is still low but I still enjoy Chess. I find it a very intense game because it is a battle of two minds to see who can outplay who.

I am a fan of IU, a Korean singer, songwrite and actress! I love Korean dramas and also spend a lot of nights just binging on episodes that never seem to end
